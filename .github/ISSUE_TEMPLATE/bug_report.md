<!--
    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.

    If you‚Äôre in a hurry or don‚Äôt feel confident, it‚Äôs fine to report bugs with
    less details, but this makes it less likely they‚Äôll get fixed soon.

    In either case, please use this template and fill in as many fields below as you can.
-->

### Describe the bug

(Write your answer here.)

### Which terms did you search for in the documentation and issue tracker?

<!--
  Some common issues with the project are detailed in the documentation.

  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.
  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.
-->

(Write your answer here if relevant.)

### Environment

<!--
  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.
  This enables the maintainers to quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.

  Which versions of the exporter are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions?
-->

(Write your answer here if relevant.)

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn‚Äôt know you or your project?
  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.
-->

(Write your steps here:)

1. First,
2. Then,
3. Finally,

### Expected behavior

<!--
  How did you expect the tool to behave?
  It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre not sure your understanding is correct.
  Just write down what you thought would happen.
-->

(Write what you thought would happen.)

### Actual behavior

<!--
  Did something go wrong?
  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?
  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.
-->

(Write what happened. Please add screenshots!)

### Reproducible demo

<!--
  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.
  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.

  There are two ways to do it:

    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.
      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can‚Äôt share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you‚Äôre left with the minimal reproducible demo.
      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.

  Once you‚Äôre done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:
-->

(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)

<!--
  What happens if you skip this step?

  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial
  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,
  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.

  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might
  create a reproducible example for it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
