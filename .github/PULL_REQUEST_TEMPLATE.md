<!-- See the general contribution guidelines in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md -->

Here, please add a description of your pull request and instructions for the reviewer to verify your work. Pull requests without an adequate description will not be reviewed until one is added.

<!-- If your pull request is for a specific ticket, this is a good place to link to it. -->

<!-- Here are guidelines to follow when creating your pull request: -->

- [ ] Stay on point and keep it small so it can be easily reviewed. For example, try to apply any general refactoring separately outside of the PR.
- [ ] Consider adding unit tests, especially for bug fixes. If you don't, tell us why.
- [ ] All new and existing tests pass, with 100% test coverage (`make test-coverage`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Consider updating documentation. If you don't, tell us why.
- [ ] List the environments / platforms in which you tested your changes.

Thanks for contributing to this project!
